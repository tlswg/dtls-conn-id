--- abstract

This document specifies the Connection ID (CID) construct for the Datagram Transport
Layer Security (DTLS) protocol version 1.2.

A CID is an identifier carried in the record layer header that gives the
recipient additional information for selecting the appropriate security association.
In "classical" DTLS, selecting a security association of an incoming DTLS record
is accomplished with the help of the 5-tuple. If the source IP address and/or
source port changes during the lifetime of an ongoing DTLS session then the
receiver will be unable to locate the correct security context.

#  Introduction

The Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) {{RFC6347}} protocol was designed for
securing connection-less transports, like UDP. DTLS, like TLS, starts
with a handshake, which can be computationally demanding (particularly
when public key cryptography is used). After a successful handshake,
symmetric key cryptography is used to apply data origin
authentication, integrity and confidentiality protection. This
two-step approach allows endpoints to amortize the cost of the initial
handshake across subsequent application data protection. Ideally, the
second phase where application data is protected lasts over a long
period of time since the established keys will only need to be updated
once the key lifetime expires.

In DTLS as specified in RFC 6347, the IP address and port of the peer are used to
identify the DTLS association. Unfortunately, in some cases, such as NAT rebinding,
these values are insufficient. This is a particular issue in the Internet of Things
when devices enter extended sleep periods to increase their battery lifetime. The
NAT rebinding leads to connection failure, with the resulting cost of a new handshake.

This document defines an extension to DTLS 1.2 to add a Connection ID (CID) to the
DTLS record layer. The presence of the CID is negotiated via a DTLS
extension.

# Conventions and Terminology

{::boilerplate bcp14}

This document assumes familiarity with DTLS 1.2 {{RFC6347}}.

# The "connection_id" Extension

This document defines the "connection_id" extension, which
is used in ClientHello and ServerHello messages.

The extension type is specified as follows.

~~~~
  enum {
     connection_id(TBD1), (65535)
  } ExtensionType;
~~~~

The extension_data field of this extension, when included in the
ClientHello, MUST contain the ConnectionId structure. This structure
contains the CID value the client wishes the server to use when sending
messages to the client. A zero-length CID value indicates that the client
is prepared to send using a CID but does not wish the server to use one when
sending.

~~~~
  struct {
      opaque cid<0..2^8-1>;
  } ConnectionId;
~~~~

A server willing to use CIDs will respond with a "connection_id"
extension in the ServerHello, containing the CID it wishes the
client to use when sending messages towards it. A zero-length value
indicates that the server will send using the client's CID but does not
wish the client to include a CID when sending.

Because each party sends the value in the "connection_id" extension it wants to
receive as a CID in encrypted records, it is possible
for an endpoint to use a deployment-specific constant length for such connection
identifiers.  This can in turn ease parsing and connection lookup,
for example by having the length in question be a compile-time constant.
Such implementations MUST still be able to send
CIDs of different length to other parties.
Since the CID length information is not included in the record itself,
implementations that want to use variable-length CIDs are responsible
for constructing the CID in such a way that its length can be determined
on reception.

In DTLS 1.2, CIDs are exchanged at the beginning of the DTLS
session only. There is no dedicated "CID update" message
that allows new CIDs to be established mid-session, because
DTLS 1.2 in general does not allow TLS 1.3-style post-handshake messages
that do not themselves begin other handshakes. When a DTLS session is
resumed or renegotiated, the "connection_id" extension is negotiated afresh.

If DTLS peers have not negotiated the use of CIDs, or a zero-length
CID has been advertised for a given direction, then the RFC
6347-defined record format and content type MUST be used to send in
the indicated direction(s).

If DTLS peers have negotiated the use of a non-zero-length CID for a
given direction, then once encryption is enabled they MUST send with
the record format defined in {{dtls-ciphertext}} with the
new MAC computation defined in {{mac}} and the content type tls12_cid.
Plaintext payloads never use the new record format or the CID content
type.

When receiving, if the tls12_cid content type is set, then the CID is
used to look up the connection and the security association. If the
tls12_cid content type is not set, then the connection and security
association is looked up by the 5-tuple and a check MUST be made to
determine whether a non-zero length CID is expected.
If a non-zero-length CID is expected for the retrieved association,
then the datagram MUST be treated as invalid, as described
in Section 4.1.2.1 of {{RFC6347}}.

When receiving a datagram with the tls12_cid content type,
the new MAC computation defined in {{mac}} MUST be used. When receiving a datagram
with the RFC 6347-defined record format, the MAC calculation defined in Section 4.1.2
of {{RFC6347}} MUST be used.

# Record Layer Extensions

This specification defines the DTLS 1.2 record layer format and
{{I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13}} specifies how to carry the CID in DTLS 1.3.

To allow a receiver to determine whether a record has a CID or not,
connections which have negotiated this extension use a distinguished
record type tls12_cid(TBD2). Use of this content type has the following
three implications:

- The CID field is present and contains one or more bytes.
- The MAC calculation follows the process described in {{mac}}.
- The real content type is inside the encryption envelope, as described
  below.

Plaintext records are not impacted by this extension. Hence, the format
of the DTLSPlaintext structure is left unchanged, as shown in {{dtls-plaintext}}.

~~~
     struct {
         ContentType type;
         ProtocolVersion version;
         uint16 epoch;
         uint48 sequence_number;
         uint16 length;
         opaque fragment[DTLSPlaintext.length];
     } DTLSPlaintext;
~~~
{: #dtls-plaintext title="DTLS 1.2 Plaintext Record Payload."}

When CIDs are being used, the content to be sent
is first wrapped along with its content type and optional padding into a
DTLSInnerPlaintext structure. This newly introduced structure is shown in
{{dtls-innerplaintext}}.

~~~
     struct {
         opaque content[length];
         ContentType real_type;
         uint8 zeros[length_of_padding];
     } DTLSInnerPlaintext;
~~~
{: #dtls-innerplaintext title="New DTLSInnerPlaintext Payload Structure."}

content
: Corresponds to the fragment of a given length.

real_type
: The content type describing the cleartext payload.

zeros
:  An arbitrary-length run of zero-valued bytes may appear in
   the cleartext after the type field.  This provides an opportunity
   for senders to pad any DTLS record by a chosen amount as long as
   the total stays within record size limits.  See Section 5.4 of
   {{RFC8446}} for more details. (Note that the term TLSInnerPlaintext in
   RFC 8446 refers to DTLSInnerPlaintext in this specification.)

The DTLSInnerPlaintext byte sequence is then encrypted. To create the
DTLSCiphertext structure shown in {{dtls-ciphertext}} the CID is added.

~~~
     struct {
         ContentType outer_type = tls12_cid;
         ProtocolVersion version;
         uint16 epoch;
         uint48 sequence_number;
         opaque cid[cid_length];               // New field
         uint16 length;
         opaque enc_content[DTLSCiphertext.length];
     } DTLSCiphertext;
~~~~
{: #dtls-ciphertext title="DTLS 1.2 CID-enhanced Ciphertext Record."}

outer_type
:  The outer content type of a DTLSCiphertext record carrying a CID
   is always set to tls12_cid(TBD2). The real content
   type of the record is found in DTLSInnerPlaintext.real_type after
   decryption.

cid
:  The CID value, cid_length bytes long, as agreed at the time the extension
   has been negotiated.  Recall that (as discussed previously) each peer chooses
   the CID value it will receive and use to identify the connection, so an
   implementation can choose to always receive CIDs of a fixed length.  If,
   however, an implementation chooses to receive different lengths of CID,
   the assigned CID values must be self-delineating since there is no other
   mechanism available to determine what connection (and thus, what CID length)
   is in use.

enc_content
:  The encrypted form of the serialized DTLSInnerPlaintext structure.

All other fields are as defined in RFC 6347.

# Record Payload Protection {#mac}

Several types of ciphers have been defined for use with TLS and DTLS and the
MAC calculations for those ciphers differ slightly.

This specification modifies the MAC calculation as defined in {{RFC6347}} and
{{!RFC7366}}, as well as the definition of the additional data used with AEAD
ciphers provided in {{RFC6347}}, for records with content type tls12_cid.  The
modified algorithm MUST NOT be applied to records that do not carry a CID, i.e.,
records with content type other than tls12_cid.

The following fields are defined in this document; all other fields are as
defined in the cited documents.

cid
: Value of the negotiated CID (variable length).

cid_length
: 1 byte field indicating the length of the negotiated CID.

length_of_DTLSInnerPlaintext
: The length (in bytes) of the serialized DTLSInnerPlaintext (two-byte integer).
  The length MUST NOT exceed 2^14.

seq_num_placeholder
: 8 bytes of 0xff

Note "+" denotes concatenation.

## Block Ciphers

The following MAC algorithm applies to block ciphers
that do not use the Encrypt-then-MAC processing
described in {{RFC7366}}.

~~~
    MAC(MAC_write_key,
        seq_num_placeholder +
        tls12_cid +
        cid_length +
        tls12_cid +
        DTLSCiphertext.version +
        epoch +
        sequence_number +
        cid +
        length_of_DTLSInnerPlaintext +
        DTLSInnerPlaintext.content +
        DTLSInnerPlaintext.real_type +
        DTLSInnerPlaintext.zeros
    );
~~~

The rationale behind this construction is to separate the MAC input
for DTLS without the connection ID from the MAC input with the
connection ID. The former always consists of a sequence number
followed by some other content type than tls12_cid; the latter
always consists of the seq_num_placeholder followed by tls12_cid.
Although 2^64-1 is potentially a valid sequence number, tls12_cid
will never be a valid content type when the connection ID is not in use.
In addition, the epoch and sequence_number are now fed into
the MAC in the same order as they appear on the wire.

## Block Ciphers with Encrypt-then-MAC processing

The following MAC algorithm applies to block ciphers
that use the Encrypt-then-MAC processing
described in {{RFC7366}}.

~~~
    MAC(MAC_write_key,
        seq_num_placeholder +
        tls12_cid +
        cid_length +
        tls12_cid +
        DTLSCiphertext.version +
        epoch +
        sequence_number +
        cid +
        DTLSCiphertext.length +
        IV +
        ENC(content + padding + padding_length));
~~~

## AEAD Ciphers

For ciphers utilizing authenticated encryption with additional
data the following modification is made to the additional data calculation.

~~~
    additional_data = seq_num_placeholder +
                      tls12_cid +
                      cid_length +
                      tls12_cid +
                      DTLSCiphertext.version +
                      epoch +
                      sequence_number +
                      cid +
                      length_of_DTLSInnerPlaintext;
~~~

# Peer Address Update {#peer-address-update}

When a record with a CID is received that has a source address
different from the one currently associated with the DTLS connection,
the receiver MUST NOT replace the address it uses for sending records
to its peer with the source address specified in the received datagram,
unless the following three conditions are met:

- The received datagram has been cryptographically verified using
the DTLS record layer processing procedures.

- The received datagram is "newer" (in terms of both epoch and sequence
number) than the newest datagram received. Reordered datagrams that are
sent prior to a change in a peer address might otherwise cause a valid
address change to be reverted. This also limits the ability of an attacker
to use replayed datagrams to force a spurious address change, which
could result in denial of service. An attacker might be able to succeed
in changing a peer address if they are able to rewrite source addresses
and if replayed packets are able to arrive before any original.

- There is a strategy for ensuring that the new peer address is able to
receive and process DTLS records. No such strategy is defined in this specification.

The conditions above are necessary to protect against attacks that use datagrams with
spoofed addresses or replayed datagrams to trigger attacks. Note that there
is no requirement for use of the anti-replay window mechanism defined in
Section 4.1.2.6 of DTLS 1.2. Both solutions, the "anti-replay window" or
"newer" algorithm, will prevent address updates from replay attacks while the
latter will only apply to peer address updates and the former applies to any
application layer traffic.

Note that datagrams that pass the DTLS cryptographic verification procedures
but do not trigger a change of peer address are still valid DTLS records and
are still to be passed to the application.

Application protocols that implement protection against these attacks depend on
being aware of changes in peer addresses so that they can engage the necessary
mechanisms. When delivered such an event, an application layer-specific
address validation mechanism can be triggered, for example one that is based on
successful exchange of a minimal amount of ping-pong traffic with the peer.
Alternatively, an DTLS-specific mechanism may be used, as described in
{{I-D.tschofenig-tls-dtls-rrc}}.

DTLS implementations MUST silently discard records with bad MACs or that are
otherwise invalid.

# Examples

{{dtls-example2}} shows an example exchange where a CID is
used uni-directionally from the client to the server. To indicate that
a zero-length CID is present in the "connection_id" extension
we use the notation 'connection_id=empty'.

~~~~

Legend:

~~~~
{: #dtls-example2 title="Example DTLS 1.2 Exchange with CID"}

Note: In the example exchange the CID is included in the record layer
once encryption is enabled. In DTLS 1.2 only one handshake message is
encrypted, namely the Finished message. Since the example shows how to
use the CID for payloads sent from the client to the server, only the
record layer payloads containing the Finished message or application data
include a CID.

#  Privacy Considerations {#priv-cons}

The CID replaces the previously used 5-tuple and, as such, introduces
an identifier that remains persistent during the lifetime of a DTLS connection.
Every identifier introduces the risk of linkability, as explained in {{RFC6973}}.

An on-path adversary observing the DTLS protocol exchanges between the
DTLS client and the DTLS server is able to link the observed payloads to all
subsequent payloads carrying the same ID pair (for bi-directional
communication).  Without multi-homing or mobility, the use of the CID
exposes the same information as the 5-tuple.

With multi-homing, a passive attacker is able to correlate the communication
interaction over the two paths. The lack of a CID update mechanism
in DTLS 1.2 makes this extension unsuitable for mobility scenarios where
correlation must be considered. Deployments that use DTLS in multi-homing
environments and are concerned about these aspects SHOULD refuse to use CIDs in
DTLS 1.2 and switch to DTLS 1.3 where a CID update mechanism is provided and
sequence number encryption is available.

The specification introduces record padding for the CID-enhanced record layer,
which is a privacy feature not available with the original DTLS 1.2 specification.
Padding allows to inflate the size of the ciphertext making traffic analysis
more difficult. More details about record padding can be found in Section 5.4
and Appendix E.3 of RFC 8446.

Finally, endpoints can use the CID to attach arbitrary per-connection metadata
to each record they receive on a given connection. This may be used as a mechanism to communicate
per-connection information to on-path observers. There is no straightforward way to
address this concern with CIDs that contain arbitrary values. Implementations
concerned about this aspect SHOULD refuse to use CIDs.

#  Security Considerations {#sec-cons}

An on-path adversary can create reflection attacks
against third parties because a DTLS peer has no means to distinguish a
genuine address update event (for example, due to a NAT rebinding) from one
that is malicious. This attack is of particular concern when the request is small
and the response large. See {{peer-address-update}} for more
on address updates.

Additionally, an attacker able to observe the data traffic exchanged between
two DTLS peers is able to replay datagrams with modified IP address/port numbers.

The topic of peer address updates is discussed in {{peer-address-update}}.

#  IANA Considerations

This document requests three actions from IANA.

## Extra Column to TLS ExtensionType Values Registry

IANA is requested to add an extra column named "DTLS-Only" to the
"TLS ExtensionType Values" registry to indicate whether an extension is only
applicable to DTLS and to include this document as an additional reference
for the registry.

## Entry to the TLS ExtensionType Values Registry

IANA is requested to allocate an entry to the existing "TLS ExtensionType
Values" registry, for connection_id(TBD1) as described
in the table below. Although the value 53 has been allocated by early allocation for a previous version of this document, it
is incompatible with this document.
Once this document is approved for publication, the early allocation will be deprecated
in favor of this assignment.

~~~~
Value   Extension Name  TLS 1.3  DTLS-Only  Recommended  Reference
--------------------------------------------------------------------
TBD1    connection_id   CH, SH   Y          N           [[This doc]]
~~~~

A new column "DTLS-Only" is added to the registry.
The valid entries are "Y" if the extension is only applicable to DTLS, "N" otherwise.
All the pre-existing entries are given the value "N".

Note: The value "N" in the Recommended column is set because this
extension is intended only for specific use cases. This document describes
the behavior of this extension for DTLS 1.2 only; it is not applicable to TLS, and
its usage for DTLS 1.3 is described in {{I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13}}.

## Entry to the TLS ContentType Registry

IANA is requested to allocate tls12_cid(TBD2) in the "TLS ContentType"
registry. The tls12_cid ContentType is only applicable to DTLS 1.2.
